# LUME


- LUME is a project to extend and generalize the [SimEx](https://github.com/eucall-software/simex_platform) platform for FEL community use.

- Wrap standard, developed electron/photon simulation codes with a common interface (pure Python) with minimal installation complexity, ultimately platform-independent (laptop to  HPC)

- Use the newly developed openPMD standard for data exchange (HDF5 files).

- Create standards for machine and beamline components database descriptions. 

- Well documented for use by developers, Ph.D. students, users (simulation as a service).

- Supporting technologies: Machine database, Simulation Catalogue, Visualization and (G)UI,Optimization hooks, PSANA integration
